🚀 YAWT: The "Pro" Roadmap

1. 🍎 The "Apple Ecosystem" Layer
Apple Watch Companion: For workouts, the phone is often an obstacle. A lightweight Watch app to tap "Next Set" is the ultimate premium feature.

3. 🛠️ Content & Customization
In-App Workout Editor: Currently, you're a "Consumer" of programs. Being able to swap an exercise (e.g., "I don't have a bench, let's do pushups") or create a program from scratch in the UI would be a game-changer.

4. 🔗 Seamless Connectivity
Program Sharing 2.0: Generating a unique URL or QR code so you can text a program to a friend for a "One-tap Import."
