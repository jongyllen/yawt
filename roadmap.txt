🚀 YAWT: The "Pro" Roadmap

1. 🍎 The "Apple Ecosystem" Layer
✅ Live Activities & Dynamic Island: Show the current set, reps, or rest-timer right on the Lock Screen while the app is in the background.
Apple Watch Companion: For workouts, the phone is often an obstacle. A lightweight Watch app to tap "Next Set" is the ultimate premium feature.

2. 📈 Intelligence & Progress
Visual Trends: The "Stats" screen currently lists counts. Adding charts for "Workouts per Week" or "Muscle Group Distribution" would make the progress feel real.
Personal Records (PRs): Auto-detecting when you lift more or do more reps and celebrating it with a "Gold Medal" haptic alert.

3. 🛠️ Content & Customization
In-App Workout Editor: Currently, you're a "Consumer" of programs. Being able to swap an exercise (e.g., "I don't have a bench, let's do pushups") or create a program from scratch in the UI would be a game-changer.
Smart Rest Timers: Adaptive timers that suggest longer rest for heavy strength sets and shorter for accessory work.

4. 🔗 Seamless Connectivity
Program Sharing 2.0: Generating a unique URL or QR code so you can text a program to a friend for a "One-tap Import."
